Question 2
Using two types of string interpolation, and given the variable a that
contains an integer, print out the following string for a:

The number ...value of a... is (or is not) even

For example, if a is 42, the your code should print:

'The number 42 is even'

But if a is 31, then the same code should print:

'The number 31 is not even'
