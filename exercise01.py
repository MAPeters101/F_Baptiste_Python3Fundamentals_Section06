Question 1
Given this string of comma separated characters, create three new variables
containing the unicode codepoint (in hex), uppercase and lower case versions
of each character (also comma delimited).

For example, if the string was 'a, b, c' you should generate three lists that
look like:

['0x61', '0x62', '0x63']
['a', 'b', 'c']
['A', 'B', 'C']
[You should use the split() and strip() functions, amongst others, to help you
solve this.]

s = 'Π, ύ, θ, ω, ν'
