Question 3
You are given two variables a and b (with b non-zero), and you need to
generate a string that reads something like this:

'a / b = (result)'
But you want your string to be nicely formatted for display purposes, so you
want to limit displaying possible digits after the decimal point in all your
values to 4 digits.
